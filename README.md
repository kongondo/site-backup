# site-backup
Complete site backup script, with files and database dump.

These scripts can be run both in normal mode (triggered by browser) or as cron job.

Just adjust a few variables (paths, DB-credentials, desired filenames etc.) and you should be good to go.

@todo:
optionally zip the .sql file as well
